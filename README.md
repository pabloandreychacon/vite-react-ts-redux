# Pizza Builder - React + TypeScript + Redux

A simple pizza builder application built with React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This project demonstrates the implementation of Redux state management in a React application.

## Redux Implementation

### Store Setup
The Redux store is configured in `src/redux/store.ts`:
```typescript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import pizzaReducer from "./reducer";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    pizza: pizzaReducer,
  },
});
```

### Redux Slice
The pizza state is managed using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice` in `src/redux/reducer.tsx`:
```typescript
const initialState = {
  toppings: ["cheese", "pepperoni"],
  size: "small",
  crust: "thin",
  pineapple: false,
  glutenFree: false,
  vegan: false,
};

const pizzaSlice = createSlice({
  name: "pizza",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    addTopping: (state, action) => {
      state.toppings.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeTopping: (state, action) => {
      state.toppings = state.toppings.filter((topping) => topping !== action.payload);
    },
    // ... other reducers
  },
});
```

### Redux Hooks Usage
The application uses Redux hooks in components:
```typescript
// Selector hook to access state
const pizza = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.pizza);

// Dispatch hook to dispatch actions
const dispatch = useDispatch();

// Example of dispatching an action
dispatch(addTopping("cheese"));
```

## Redux Concepts Used

### 1. Store
- The central state container
- Created using `configureStore` from Redux Toolkit
- Holds the complete state tree of the application

### 2. Reducers
- Pure functions that specify how the state changes
- Implemented using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`
- Each reducer handles a specific part of the state

### 3. Actions
- Payloads of information that send data to the store
- Automatically generated by Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`
- Examples: `addTopping`, `removeTopping`

### 4. Selectors
- Functions that extract specific pieces of state
- Used with the `useSelector` hook
- Example: `state.pizza.toppings`

### 5. Dispatch
- Function used to send actions to the store
- Accessed via the `useDispatch` hook
- Used to trigger state changes

## State Management Flow

1. **State Access**
   ```typescript
   const pizza = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.pizza);
   ```

2. **Action Dispatch**
   ```typescript
   dispatch(addTopping("cheese"));
   ```

3. **State Update**
   - Reducer processes the action
   - State is updated immutably
   - Components re-render with new state

## Available Actions

- `addTopping(topping: string)`: Adds a topping to the pizza
- `removeTopping(topping: string)`: Removes a topping from the pizza
- `setSize(size: string)`: Sets the pizza size
- `setCrust(crust: string)`: Sets the pizza crust type
- `setPineapple(value: boolean)`: Toggles pineapple preference
- `setGlutenFree(value: boolean)`: Toggles gluten-free option
- `setVegan(value: boolean)`: Toggles vegan option

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- Vite
- Bootstrap 5

## TypeScript Integration

The project uses TypeScript for type safety. Key type definitions include:

- `RootState`: Type for the complete Redux state
- Action payload types
- Component prop types
- Event handler types

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript for all components and Redux code
   - Proper type definitions for state and actions

2. **State Management**
   - Centralized state management with Redux
   - Immutable state updates
   - Predictable state changes

3. **Code Organization**
   - Separate Redux logic in dedicated files
   - Clear component structure
   - Modular and maintainable code

4. **UI/UX**
   - Responsive design with Bootstrap
   - Clear user feedback
   - Intuitive interface
